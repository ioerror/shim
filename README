shim -- wedge this HTTP proxy between your browser and Tor 

Dependencies
-------------

You'll need Libevent 2 or greater!


How to Build and Install
-------------------------

0. Install Libevent 2 somewhere if it hasn't been already.
1. ./autogen.sh # if ./configure isn't in your source directory
2. ./configure
3. make
4. make install

Notes: 
* If you installed Libevent somewhere non-standard, you might need to export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH or LIBEVENT_CFLAGS and LIBEVENT_LIBS environment variables, and
then run ./configure again.

* If you're concerned about the proxy making direct connections (including
connections to HTTP servers and DNS servers), you can add the
--disable-direct-connections switch to configure. This will force you to
run shim with a SOCKS 4a server, returning an error message if one isn't
configured. This is the default, so if you want to have shim make direct
connections, you'll need to recompile it with --enable-direct-connections.

* If you're trying to debug a problem, and you're using GNU GCC, GDB etc,
you can:

	make clean
	make CFLAGS='-g -Wall'

... to prevent optimization that might interfere with your GDB sessions.
