Changes in 0.1.1 - 2013-01-XX
  * Add compiler hardening flags
  * Add '-d' daemon flag (Thanks to David Hill)
  * Add manpage 'shim.1'
  * Ensure that direct connections are now disabled by default
    This may be enabled at compile time but it allows shim to leak data
    outside of a configured proxy. Use with caution!
  * Add basic AppArmor profile
Changes in 0.1.0 - 2010-03-28
  * Initial release
